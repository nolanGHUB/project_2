### MVP

_The **Worth Watching** MVP will consist of a television search by title name which will show a list of results.  These results will be click-through-able to their own page with more information about that particular show. This detail page will house suggestions for similar shows which will also link to their own detail page.  The detail page should consist of the shows poster image, title, description, misc info and similar shows._

#### Goals

- _More category pages:_
- _Discovery - Ability to adjust search terms to search for shows that interest you!_
- _Currently airing - Adjustable to show top shows airing today/tonight with sorting options!_
- _Trending/Popular this week - Will show top trending shows this week & Top rated/Currently Popular shows as a showList._
- _Perhaps a search for show creators/people_
- _Top Rated shows by genre? - Adjustable query term? Dropdown?_
- _Bookmarking feature as you search through shows, you can ear-mark them to see everything you've put aside for yourself_
- _Different View options for the ShowList (results after search), Grid view or list view* - Button that allows user to choose which view they prefer?_
- _Different Sorting Options for currently airing and showList_
